# Seizure Detection System Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Seizure Detection System project, which aims to develop a machine learning model to detect epileptic seizures in patient data. The project consists of multiple phases, each addressing specific tasks and challenges in the development of a robust and effective seizure detection system Which is done by Faridreza Momtaz Zandi and Mehrnaz Sadeghie and is one of our most proud university projects.

## Project Phases

- [**Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**](Phase1_README.md)
    - In this phase, the focus is on collecting and preparing the dataset for further analysis. We acquire EEG data from the [CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database](https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/) and preprocess it to extract useful features And took a look on how these features are by running three classification methods on them.

- [**Phase 2: Feature Engineering and Selection**](phase2/README.md)
    - Phase 2 concentrates on feature engineering, where we extract relevant features from EEG data. The README for this phase provides insights into the feature extraction process and the selected features that are deemed significant for detecting seizures.

- [**Phase 3: Neural Network Implementation**](phase3/README.md)
    - In this phase, a neural network, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is implemented for the classification of EEG data into seizure and non-seizure classes.

## Project Goals

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a seizure detection system that can accurately and efficiently identify epileptic seizures in real-time EEG data. The system aims to provide timely interventions by automatically administering medication when a seizure is detected.

## How to Use the Project

Each phase has its own README file with detailed instructions and code to follow. You can navigate to the respective phase's README for specific information and implementation details.

1. Start with [Phase 1](Phase1_README.md) to learn about data acquisition and preprocessing.
2. Move on to [Phase 2](Phase2_README.md) to understand the feature engineering process.
3. Finally, explore [Phase 3](Phase3_README.md) to see the implementation of the neural network and the presentation of results.

The project is organized into separate notebooks, and you can follow along with each phase to build a comprehensive seizure detection system.
